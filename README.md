# Coffee Tracker

Based on the idea by James 
## Setup MCP Server

## Create project 

I created the aspire default web app project in visual studio and moved the projects to match my requirements

- infrastructure
  - AppHost
  - ServiceDefaults
- src
  - ApiService
  - web

  this was run inside vscode to ensure it runs correctly

## add swagger config to api so we can see the endpoints
